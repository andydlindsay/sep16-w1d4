# W1D4 - Callbacks!

## To Do
- [x] Functions as values
- [x] Function calling vs passing (reference to a function)
- [x] Callback functions and Higher Order functions
- [x] Intro to anonymous functions
- [x] Implementing our own forEach and/or our own filter
- [x] Arrow Functions (and their common use for callback functions)
- [x] Nested scope and "scope chain"

## What is a callback?
- A callback is a function that gets passed to another function to be executed by that function
- Callback functions are used all over the place in JavaScript
- They encapsulate reusable code that can be passed around like any other JS variable

## Functions are Values
- Just like everything else in JavaScript, functions are values
- As a result, they can be stored in variables just like any other value

```js
const myFunction = function() {
  // do something
};
```

- They can also be passed around just like any other variable

```js
const myFunction = function() {
  // do something
}
const myVar = myFunction;
myVar(); // equivalent to calling myFunction()
```

- And they can be passed to other functions as arguments

```js
const myFunction = function() {
  // do something
}
const myHigherOrderFunction = function(callback) {
  callback(); // equivalent to myFunction()
}
myHigherOrderFunction(myFunction);
```

- We call the function that we pass as an argument a **callback**
- We call the function that accepts a function as an argument a **higher order function**

## Anonymous Functions
- We can pass callback functions _inline_ to a higher order function rather than storing the callback in a variable first

```js
const myHigherOrderFunction = function(callback) {
  callback();
}
myHigherOrderFunction(function() {
  // do something
});
```

- Anonymous functions are simply functions that do not have a name

## Arrow Functions
- Arrow functions give us a syntactic alternative to using the `function` keyword

```js
// function keyword
const myFunc = function() {
  // do something
};

// arrow function
const myArrowFunc = () => {
  // do something
};
```

- There are some _gotchas_ around using the `this` keyword inside an arrow function, but if you aren't using `this`, arrow functions can be used interchangeably with "regular" functions
- Arrow functions are often used as callbacks because they are shorter/cleaner to type

```js
arr.forEach(function(element) {
  // do something
});

// vs
arr.forEach((element) => {
  // do something
});
```
